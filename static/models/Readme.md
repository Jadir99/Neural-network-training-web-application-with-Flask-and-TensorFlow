Machine Learning Model Usage Guide

This document provides instructions on how to use the machine learning model saved in the .h5 format. The model is designed to handle both regression and classification tasks.

Prerequisites
Before using the model, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or later
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Numpy

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

pip install tensorflow pandas numpy

Setup
1. Clone the Repository (if applicable):
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

2. Download the Model:
   Ensure the .h5 model file is in your project directory. You can rename it to something descriptive, such as model.h5.

Loading the Model
To load the machine learning model, use the following code snippet:

import tensorflow as tf

# Load the model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('model.h5')

Making Predictions
To make predictions using the loaded model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your input data in the format expected by the model. This usually means preprocessing your data to match the training format.

2. Use the model to make predictions:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Example input data (adjust shape as needed)
# For regression, input shape might be (n_samples, n_features)
# For classification, ensure you have the right number of classes
input_data = np.array([[value1, value2, value3]])  # Replace with your input features

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(input_data)

# If it's a classification problem, you might want to get class labels
predicted_classes = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)  # For multi-class classification
print(predicted_classes)

Sample Code
Hereâ€™s a complete example of loading a model and making predictions:

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Load the model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('model.h5')

# Prepare input data
input_data = np.array([[0.5, 0.2, 0.1]])  # Replace with your data

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(input_data)

# Display results
print("Predictions:", predictions)

Notes
- Ensure your input data is properly preprocessed. This may include scaling, normalization, or encoding categorical variables, depending on how the model was trained.
- Review the model's training specifications to understand its expected input shape and any preprocessing steps that were applied.
- If you encounter any errors, check the TensorFlow documentation for troubleshooting.
